                    Location: The round tower stands in a lovely setting across a picturesque footbridge that crosses the Bauteogue river in the center of the village.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features: The Round Tower is completely intact, escept for the floors or ladders. It has one a great example of a Romanesque doorway,
                    with extensive & intricate doorway carving with interlace, capitals and chevrons. It is unique in round tower architecture in Ireland.
                    Romanesque doorways, usually reserved for more important buildings, are a labour-intensive decoration on a flat surface making the fact it was
                    constructed on a curved surface and off the ground all the more impressive.
                </p>

                    History: Saint Mochua, who died in 657, established a monastery here in the seventh-century. Burned down in 1142, it was re-founded by the O'Mores,
                    one of the seven septs of Laois. The twelfth-century Round Tower is all that remains of the
                    original monastery. After the ‘Suppression’ in 1556, the monastery and lands were granted to Sir Thomas Loftus and later (1609) to Richard Cosby.
                    It was probably one of the Cosby family who transformed what was a medieval church into a castle. The last friar of the monastery was killed in 1650.

                <p>
                    On the same setting as the tower stands a ruin, once a 15th century church (with blocked archway) that had been fortified as a "castle" in the 17th
                    century. Only the east wall of the castle, incorporating the arch of the medieval church remains. Close by is also a heritage centre where more
                    information can be found about the local area. This building was the local library up until recently and before that, a protestant church.
