                <h3> I would like to introduce you to a little town in County Laois called Timahoe.</h3>

                <br>
                <p>
                    A small idyllic village of around 600 hundred people, Timahoe has alot to offer visitors in the way of heritage and services.
                    All activities revolve around the centre of the village, commonly known as 'The Green'. A tipple can be had in one of the two
                    local public houses. Supplies can be found in 'The Corner Shop'. An upholstery shop provides a quality service to its patrons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And last but certainly not least, the heritage centre is able to cater for all the history buffs out there looking to find out
                    more about our wonderful and unique Round Tower, which is one of the best examples of such structures in the country. More on
                    this in the History Section!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please feel free to wander the village at your leisure. and take in all that Timahoe has to offer. Our business owners are always
                    at hand to give a helping hand to any travellers for all that they might need. Enjoy!!!
